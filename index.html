          <PRE><CODE CLASS=R>
          <br>I wrote code to create several graphs to explore income inequality with W2 tax data.</br> <br>I then made maps of different states to explore income inequality with W2s across state counties. </br>

gender_nat <- read.csv("C:/Users/Owner/Desktop/CSCI 125/Final
Project/gender_nat.csv")

Project/gender_cty.csv")
1. First we looked at a graph of the percentage of kids who had positive earning based on
their W2 against their parents' income percentile, separated by gender. We thought
this would be an important thing to look at because children's income is heavily
influenced by their parents' income. We wanted to determine if this effect was any
different for males and females. Our graph shows that among parents with low
incomes, females were more likely than males to have positive earnings, but among
parents with higher incomes, about the 30th percentile and above, males were more
likely than females to have positive earnings.
gender<-c(rep("F",100),rep("M",100))
percentile<-c(gender_nat$par_pctile,gender_nat$par_pctile)
college<-c(gender_nat$coll1823_f*100,gender_nat$coll1823_m*100)
w2<-c(gender_nat$w2_or_sc_nz_30_f, gender_nat$w2_or_sc_nz_30_m)
kids_individual_rank<-c(gender_nat$kid_indv_rank_30_f,
gender_nat$kid_indv_rank_30_m)
m2<-data.frame(cbind(percentile,college,gender, w2, kids_individual_rank),
stringsAsFactors=F)
#head(m2)
ggplot(data=m2, aes(x=as.numeric(percentile), y=as.numeric(w2),
col=as.factor(gender)))+geom_point()+scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,100,10))
+scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,10,.1))+labs(x="Parents' Income
Percentile",y="Percentage of Kids with positive W2
earnings",color="Gender")+ggtitle("Percent That Had Positive W2 Earnings by
Parents' Income Percentile and Gender of Kid")
2. We wanted to investigate the relationship between parents' income and the percent of
children that go to college, and to see whether there is a difference for men and
women.
college<-c(gender_nat$coll1823_f*100,gender_nat$coll1823_m*100)
gender<-c(rep("F",100),rep("M",100))
percentile<-c(gender_nat$par_pctile,gender_nat$par_pctile)
m2<-data.frame(cbind(percentile,college,gender),stringsAsFactors = F)
#Plot
ggplot(data =
m2,aes(x=as.numeric(percentile),y=as.numeric(college)))+geom_point(aes(color=
factor(gender)))+
 scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,100,10))+
 scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,100,10))+
 labs(x="Parents' Income Percentile",y="Percent Attending College")+
 labs(color="Gender")+
 ggtitle("Percent Attending College by Parents' Income Percentile and
Gender")
This shows that more women than men attend college, regardless of parents' income level.
However, the gap is largest for low-income people and shrinks considerably at the highest
income percentiles.
<div class = "myanswer4">
3. We wanted to investigate whether there would be a difference in the income earnings
of a parent if they had a male or female. Interestingly, there is a small correlation
based on the graph. Parents with a male child tend to make more money than parents
with female children.
q3<-ggplot()+geom_point(data=gender_nat,
aes(x=w2_pos_30_f,y=par_pctile,color="F"))+geom_point(data=gender_nat,aes(x=w
2_pos_30_m,y=par_pctile,color="M"))+xlab("Male(Blue) vs
Female(Red)")+ylab('W2 Earnings by Income Percentile')+ggtitle("Average W-2
Earnings By Parents' Income Percentile: Male vs Female")
print(q3) 
4. For this graph we wanted to investigate whether there was a correlation between
going to college and W2 earnings when the students are 30. There is, but even if both
females and males attend college, males make more. Not only that, but some males
who were in the smaller percentile of attending college (so, some didn't) earned more
than their female counterparts who overall had a higher rate of college attendance.
q4<-ggplot()+geom_point(data=gender_nat,
aes(x=w2wages_30_f,y=coll1823_f,color="F"))+geom_point(data=gender_nat,aes(x=
w2wages_30_m,y=coll1823_m,color="M"))+xlab("Wage at 30")+ylab("Percent Who
Went to College")+ggtitle("Percent Who Went to College vs How Much They Earn
at 30")
print(q4)
</div>
5. In this question, we wanted to see what the trend was for the differences in US Income
Rankings between ages 26-30. We wanted to compare these differences for males and
females. To do this, first we determined the differences between males at age 26 and
subtracted males at age 30, and did the same with females. We plotted this against the
parent income percentile.
femdif<-gender_nat$kid_indv_rank_26_f-gender_nat$kid_indv_rank_30_f
maledif<-gender_nat$kid_indv_rank_26_m-gender_nat$kid_indv_rank_30_m
differences<-data.frame("gender"=gender,"differences"=c(femdif,maledif))
m3<-data.frame(cbind(percentile,college,gender, w2, differences),
stringAsFactors=F)
mean(femdif)
## [1] 0.009131601
mean(maledif)
## [1] -0.009277805
ggplot(data =
m3,aes(x=as.numeric(percentile),y=as.numeric(differences)))+geom_point(aes(co
lor=factor(gender)))+
scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,100,10))+
scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(-1,1,.01))+
labs(x="Parents' Income Percentile",y="Differences in Income Ranking Ages 26
to 30")+
labs(color="Gender")+
ggtitle("Differences in Ranking 26-30 by Parents' Income Percentile and
Gender")
This shows a trend of males having a negative value for the difference in income ranking
between 26 and 30 years of age, and women having a positive difference. This means that
men tend to have a higher income ranking at age 30 than when they were 26, and women
tend to have a lower ranking. However, the differences are very small, and it is possible
that these are inconsequential.
6. Similar to our first question, we also looked at kids' income percentile versus parents'
income percentile, separated by the gender of the kid. This graph showed us that at
every level of parental income percentile, males had a higher income percentile than
females.
gender<-c(rep("F",100),rep("M",100))
percentile<-c(gender_nat$par_pctile,gender_nat$par_pctile)
w2<-c(gender_nat$w2_or_sc_nz_30_f, gender_nat$w2_or_sc_nz_30_m)
kids_individual_rank<-c(gender_nat$kid_indv_rank_30_f,
gender_nat$kid_indv_rank_30_m)
m2<-data.frame(cbind(percentile,college,gender, w2, kids_individual_rank),
stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

7. In this question, we wanted to determine if there is any significant disparity in not
only the genders' report of their w2s, but also how their parents' marriage status
might affect that. In order to do this, we made factors of both gender and marital
status, and superimposed them onto one graph in order to see the different trends.

It appears that men who had parents who were together have the highest percentage of
positive w2s at age 30. There is very little difference in the trends of the data for male and
single parents, female and together parents, and female and single parents. However, it is
interesting that the females who had single parents and were below the 50th percentile
had a higher percentage of positive w2 when compared to males with single parents and
females with together parents.
8. We next wanted to investigate the gap in male and female earnings, and to see
whether this gap was affected by how wealthy the people's parents were. We
subtracted female earnings from male earnings and plotted this against parents
in'come percentile.
w2dif<-gender_nat$w2wages_30_m-gender_nat$w2wages_30_f
m8<-data.frame(cbind(gender_nat$par_pctile,w2dif),stringsAsFactors = F)
#Plot
ggplot(data = m8,aes(x=as.numeric(V1),y=as.numeric(w2dif)))+geom_point()+

 labs(x="Parents' Income Percentile",y="Gap between male and female W2 
earnings")+
 ggtitle("W2 Earnings Gender Gap by Parents' Income Percentile")
We found a positive wage gap at all levels, indicating that men earned more than women
regardless of parent income. This gap increased at higher parental incomes, with large
jumps in the gender wage gaps at the very highest incomes.

We wanted to know which counties in Minnesota had the highest and lowest percentages
of for positive W2 earnings for men and for women. To investigate this we created maps of
the percent of women and the percent of men in each county in Minnesota that had positive
W2 earnings at age 30.
#Subset data since we just want MN
gender_mn<-subset(gender_cty,statename=="Minnesota")
#In order to merge we need county names to be all lower case. Using sapply to
fix entire vector

states<-map_data("state")

#Creating base plot of Minnesota, will add additional layers to this

There don't appear to be large differences. Some counties had higher percentage for
women and others had higher percentages for men. We also had some missing data for
men, so we don't have a complete map.

Cory decided to do the difference between the positive W2 earnings in Washington state
because it is where she is from. Here, there isn't a substantial difference either.

For this question, we wanted to get exemplary status for doing the same mapping
technique to the state of Kentucky. We did this because think that this is a good way to
compare to another state, and also, because our professor is from Kentucky.

There doesn't appear to be a substantial difference in instances of positive w2s between
men and women in Kentucky. Although some of the counties show women with a lesser
percentage than men, others show women with a higher percentage.

        <p>Progess:<br>I have ordered the deck and the special 83mm wheels to attach the motors to. The wheels need to be 83mm in order to secure the motor and gears to the wheels without the hardware being to close to the ground and running the risk of being destroyed. So unless you can buy a skateboard with 83mm wheels premade it is cheaper to buy a seperate deck and attatch the wheels afterward. <br>This project is in progress, check back soon for more updates!</br> </p>
